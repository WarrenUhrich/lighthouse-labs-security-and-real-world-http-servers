## Storing Passwords

* We've been storing passwords in plain text...
* Cons...
  * Easy to see in the console, in the variable, in the database...
  * The owner of the site can read everyone's passwords
  * If anyone hacks, they just have all the plain text passwords with no protection
  * A huge security risk and concern!

* Passwords are often hashed...
* Hashing! This is one way we can make password storage more secure...
* Hashing is a one-way scrambling of data

* "Sessions" or encrypted cookies and HTTPS uses encryption...
* Encryption! Encryption is a two-way street.
* You scramble data.. but there should be a way to descramble.
